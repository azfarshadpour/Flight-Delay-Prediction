# Midterm_project
Using Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms to create predictions of flight delays.


In this repository we are utalizing historical flight data, to use in Supervised Machine learning (ML) algorithims.

The tables we will initally be analyzing are as follows: 


flights: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in years 2018 and 2019.

fuel_comsumption: The fuel comsumption of different airlines from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.

passengers: The passenger totals on different routes from years 2015-2019 aggregated per month.

flights_test: The departure and arrival information about flights in US in January 2020. This table will be used for evaluation. For submission, we are required to predict delays on flights from first 7 days of 2020 (1st of January - 7th of January). We can find sample submission in file sample_submission.csv

On the aforementioned data, we will perform data exploration analysis techniques, which we will further use in ML modeling. From the statistical models selected, we have formulated data insights, which will allow our final algorithim to make accurate and percise predictions inregard to airline flight delays.
